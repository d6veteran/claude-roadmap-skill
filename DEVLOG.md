## [2026-03-26] Added lint check requirement to SKILL.md

**Category:** `feature`
**Tags:** `lint`, `code-quality`, `skill-behavior`, `cross-tool`
**Risk Level:** `low`
**Breaking Change:** `no`

### Summary
Added a "Lint Check" subsection to the Project Context section, requiring the skill to verify the target project has a linter configured on first use per session.

### Detail
- New subsection placed after "Project Context (First Use Per Session)", before "ROADMAP.md Structure"
- Same stack-appropriate linter list as all other code-katz tools: Ruff, ESLint/Biome, SwiftLint, golangci-lint, clippy, pre-commit
- Part of a cross-tool effort to standardize lint checks across all code-katz tools

### Decisions Made
- **Same placement pattern as devlog skill** — both skills have identical "Project Context (First Use Per Session)" sections, so the lint check goes in the same relative position for consistency

## [2026-03-10] First production use validated — nvoss-dashboard

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `validation`, `production`, `nvoss-dashboard`
**Risk Level:** `low`
**Breaking Change:** `no`

### Summary
Skill validated in a real project session — used on `nvoss-dashboard` to create and populate a ROADMAP.md. Skill triggered correctly, generated the two-section structure, and committed cleanly.

### Detail
- First real-world invocation confirmed the trigger conditions, ROADMAP.md template, and git workflow all work as designed
- `/roadmap` slash command added to `claude-team-cli` and installed — available in all Claude Code sessions alongside `/devlog`
- Both companion skills (`claude-devlog-skill`, `claude-roadmap-skill`) now listed in the `claude-dev-team` README under "Companion Skills" with a combined install block

## [2026-03-10] v1 shipped — SKILL.md, README, project structure

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `v1`, `init`, `skill`, `roadmap`
**Risk Level:** `low`
**Breaking Change:** `no`

### Summary
Initial release of `claude-roadmap-skill` — a Claude Code skill that maintains a living `ROADMAP.md` with a current roadmap section and an append-only revision history.

### Detail
- **SKILL.md** — Full skill definition including trigger conditions, ROADMAP.md structure, revision history entry format, 8 change types, workflow, and style guidelines
- **README.md** — Same marketing treatment as `claude-devlog-skill`: problem statement, ICP, before/after exchange, change types table, installation and usage
- **Two-section design**: Current Roadmap (updated in place) + Revision History (append-only) — this is the key structural decision that distinguishes it from the devlog

### Decisions Made
- Chose a two-section document over a purely append-only format because roadmaps need a "current state" view — you shouldn't have to read history entries to find the active Tier 1 list
- Modeled revision history entry format on devlog entries but replaced `Category`/`Risk Level`/`Breaking Change` with `Change Type`/`Triggered by`/`Items Affected` — more relevant fields for roadmap changes
- Kept 8 change types (`snapshot`, `add`, `complete`, `defer`, `remove`, `reprioritize`, `reframe`, `scope-change`) to cover the full lifecycle of a roadmap item without over-engineering
- River is the natural persona owner but the skill is persona-agnostic — any team member can trigger it
